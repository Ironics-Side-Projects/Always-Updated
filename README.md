# 👑 Always Updated

Always Updated is a modpack that prioritizes updating quickly to the latest snapshots having the best optimization mods and configurations that are avaliable for the current Minecraft snapshot. There are very minimal quality of life (QoL) mods if you are expecting other ones you are going to need to add your own or use another modpack like [Elixir](https://modrinth.com/modpack/elixir) which also updates to the latest snapshots while having many QoL and resource pack compatibility related mods. _(Elixir is not made by me)_

## Maintenance
When a new Minecraft snapshot or release comes out, I will stop supporting all earlier versions of the modpack. This pack is only updated and maintained for the most recent snapshot or official release. I will update the release channel for all older versions from Release to Beta. I try to update the modpack as fast as possible but I cannot update any faster as I tend to wait for the Sodium maintainer to update to the latest snapshot.

## Versioning

Always Updated uses a simplified versioning system as of January 22nd, 2026. Each release is identified by a single incremental number that increases by one with every update.

## FAQ
**Q:** Why is the "Game Version" on Modrinth showing as blank?

**A:** The "Game Version" may show as blank on Modrinth because their API isn't always updated to the latest snapshot version.

**Q:** Will you backport or fix X version?

**A:** If an [issue request](https://github.com/Ironics-Side-Projects/Always-Updated/issues) is created I will.

_I made this because I play on the server [8bit.pt](https://www.youtube.com/@8bitpt) and most optimization modpacks dont update to snapshots._
