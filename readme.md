## Always Updated

Always Updated is a modpack prioritizes updating quickly to the latest snapshots having the best optimization mods and configurations that are avaliable for the current Minecraft snapshot. There are no quality of life mods if you are expecting those you are going to need to add your own.

## Maintenance
When a new Minecraft snapshot or release comes out, such as 1.21.11, we will stop supporting all earlier versions of the modpack. This pack is only updated and maintained for the most recent snapshot or official release. We will make every old version change to the Beta instead of Release for the release channel.

## Versioning
Always Updated follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), using a version number format of `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Updates to the version number follow these guidelines:

- Major: Incremented when substantial changes are made that significantly alter performance metrics or compatibility with existing mods, potentially requiring users to adjust settings or configurations.
- Minor: Incremented when new performance enhancements are added, such as new optimization features or resource management improvements, ensuring that these additions do not disrupt current setups.
- Patch: Incremented when minor performance issues are resolved or optimizations are applied, providing users with incremental improvements without the need for significant changes to their configurations

_I made this because I play on the server [8bit.pt](https://www.youtube.com/@8bitpt) and most optimization modpacks dont update to snapshots._
