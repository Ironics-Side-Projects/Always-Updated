## Always Updated

Always Updated is a modpack prioritizes updating quickly to the latest snapshots having the best optimization mods and configurations that are avaliable for the current Minecraft snapshot. There are very minimal quality of life (QoL) mods if you are expecting other ones you are going to need to add your own. If you would like more QoL mods while still being updated to snapshots try out [Elixir](https://modrinth.com/modpack/elixir) _(not made by me)_.

## Maintenance
When a new Minecraft snapshot or release comes out, we will stop supporting all earlier versions of the modpack. This pack is only updated and maintained for the most recent snapshot or official release. We will make every old version change to the Beta instead of Release for the release channel. We have always updated faster than any other modpack we cannot update any faster as we wait for the Sodium maintainer to update to the latest snapshot.

## Versioning
Always Updated follows a new custom versioning format starting December 1st 2025, using a version number format of `<major>.<minor>-<snapshot number>`.

## FAQ
**Q:** Why is the "Game Version" on Modrinth showing as blank?

**A:** The "Game Version" may show as blank on Modrinth because their API isn't always updated to the latest snapshot version.

**Q:** Will you backport or fix X version?

**A:** If an [issue request](https://github.com/Ironics-Side-Projects/Always-Updated/issues) is created I will.

_I made this because I play on the server [8bit.pt](https://www.youtube.com/@8bitpt) and most optimization modpacks dont update to snapshots._
